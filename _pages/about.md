I am a second-year Ph.D. student in Mathematics{:target="_blank"} at the University of Northeastern, fortunate to be advised by Prof. Paul hand{:target="_blank"}. My research focuses on the high-dimensional probability in Machine Learning, with a particular emphasis on Compressed Sensing. 

Prior to my doctoral studies, I graduated from University of Chicago{:target="_blank"}, majoring in Computational and Applied Mathematics. 

I am committed to bridging the gap between theoretical statistics and practical Compressed sensing problem.
