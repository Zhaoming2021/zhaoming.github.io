I am a second-year Ph.D. student in [Mathematics](https://cos.northeastern.edu/mathematics/){:target="_blank"} at the University of Northeastern. My research focuses on the high-dimensional probability in Machine Learning, with a particular emphasis on Compressed Sensing. 

Prior to my doctoral studies, I got my master degree from [University of Chicago](https://cam.uchicago.edu/){:target="_blank"}, majoring in Computational and Applied Mathematics. I obtained my bachelor's degree in [Mathematics](https://sms.hainanu.edu.cn/){:target="_blank"} at Hainan University.

I am committed to bridging the gap between theoretical statistics and practical Compressed Sensing problem.
